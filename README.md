Tutorial TripleA Gameplay

This is a tutorial for players new to TripleA and it's Game-engine.
The aim is to have it included in the Gamedownloadpackage and available as a button on the left side of the TripleA startscreen.
This way anyone that downloaded the game can easily start with the tutorial. 

The tutorial is built up as a campaign reflecting the expansion of Axis forces Germany and Italy in Europe and Africa.
It handles basic game concepts, movement, battle, technology and units with their unique properties.
Notifications and gamenotes provide the storyline and all information.
It is designed to enable people with no prior knowledge of TripleA or similar games to complete it.

The campaign is played on the World War II Europe map, using Revised units and rules.
The tutorial does not handle grand strategy. For this a second strategy tutorial can and might get developed, using a similar concept.
Anyone feeling like taking this up please do.

Any feedback is welcome.
