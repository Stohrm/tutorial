Tutorial TripleA Gameplay

This is a tutorial for players new to TripleA and its game engine.

The tutorial is built up as a campaign reflecting the expansion of Axis forces Germany and Italy in Europe and Africa.
It handles basic game concepts, movement, battle, technology and units with their unique properties.
Notifications and gamenotes provide the storyline and all information.
It is designed to enable people with no prior knowledge of TripleA or similar games to complete it.

The campaign is played on the World War II Europe map, using Revised units and rules.
The tutorial does not handle grand strategy. For this a second strategy tutorial can and might get developed, using a similar concept.
Anyone feeling like taking this up please do.

Any feedback is welcome.

OKay, I'm new to GitHub and I suppose you might have provided the "how to" in regards to leaving said welcome feedback within it somewhere;but...
Wouldn't it make more sense to add that information right here (too)?  As, I do have feedback.  So, for now I'll just put it here as well; but, feel free to educate me on a better way to do so in the future.

1.  Allow me to start by saying I really enjoy your tutorial.  In fact, I prefer it over the game itself.
2a. I'd like to see the Artillery Unit added prior to the tank or just after one's first combat.  Please.
2b. I could make changes to the "fork" that's here; but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with doing so (or that they'd be welcome; we'll see).
3.  The first time I played the game: I did not realize that I needed to set the AI up prior to sarting the game.  You might put that information/recommendation at the start of your notes.  I set all to Hard AI and then set Germany and Italy to Human.  But, someone who's totally new to the game wouldn't realize to do that.
4.  Battleship repair defaults to the end of the player's turn and is not changeable.  I would suggest changing that to the beginning of the turn and making it an option.  This adds 2 things to the tutorial: First, it teaches the concept of double teaming; second, it introduces one to the use of the Map Options feature.

Okay, well that's enough for now.  Yes, I'd like to see Paratroopers added; as well as half-tracks.  But we'll see how these few ideas go over first.

Thank you,
